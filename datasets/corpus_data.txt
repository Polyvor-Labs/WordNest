World Scouting was founded on July 25, 1907, when Robert Baden-Powell, then serving as a Lieutenant General in the British Army, organized a camping event. It is known that from childhood, Baden-Powell had a keen interest in nature and loved exploring the forests around his school. While serving as a military officer and being deployed in various wars, he was tasked with leading scouting activities.
After the war, Robert Baden-Powell developed “Aids to Scouting” for young members and held an eight‐day camp on Brownsea Island. Brownsea Island is the largest island in Poole’s harbor, Dorset, England. One year after the camp, Baden-Powell wrote a book titled Scouting for Boys, which explained the basic principles of scouting. In addition, he established a scouting movement exclusively for boys under the name Scouting for Boys. His guidebook for the movement spread throughout the world in various languages.
In 1910, Baden-Powell decided to retire from the army and devote all his time to Scouting. In 1912, together with his sister Agnes, he formed a scouting organization for girls called the Girls’ Guides, which later became known as the Girl Scouts. Four years later, in 1916, a junior scouting group called CUB (Wolf Cubs) was established. The activities of this group were based on the guidelines from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. As scouting grew, Baden-Powell founded the Rover Scouts in 1918—an organization that catered to youths aged 17 and older.
In 1920, the first World Jamboree was held at Olympia Hall in London, where scouts from 27 countries were invited to participate. At that time, Baden-Powell was also designated as the Chief Scout of the World. (Below is a timeline of the years in which the World Jamboree events have been held to date.)
Meanwhile, in Indonesia, scouting began with the emergence of a Dutch organization called NPO (Netherlandesche Padvinders Organisatie) in 1912. In 1916, this organization changed its name to NIPV, which stands for Netherland Indies Padvinders Vereeniging (the Dutch East Indies Scouting Association). In the same year, Mangkunegara VII established Indonesia’s first scouting organization, known as JPO (Javaansche Padvinder Organisatie). The birth of JPO spurred a national movement to create other scouting organizations—until they were eventually banned by the Dutch. Nevertheless, Indonesian national heroes found ways to continue the movement, and scouting continued to develop. In 1938, a forum for all scouting organizations was formed, called BPPKI (Badan Pusat Persaudaraan Kepanduan Indonesia). Later, on August 14, 1961, through Presidential Decree Number 448 of 1961, President Soekarno established the Panji Gerakan Pramuka. Since then, August 14 has been celebrated as the Birth Day of the Scouting Movement—a symbol of Indonesian scouting unity.
The Stato della Città del Vaticano, or Vatican City, is a country in Southern Europe located within the city of Rome, Italy. Although situated within a city, Vatican City has been an independent nation since 1929. Prior to its independence, the territory was under the aegis of the Roman Empire. Over the centuries—from the Roman Empire through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and into the Modern Era—the Roman Catholic Church began to rise to prominence, beginning with Peter, one of Jesus’ most famous disciples. Peter is recognized as the leader and the first Bishop of Rome. According to historical records, Peter died in the Circus of Nero near Vatican Hill, where today a basilica stands in his honor. Soon after, the Catholic community, unwilling to remain in endless mourning, appointed Linus as his successor.
Over the centuries following Saint Peter’s martyrdom, the Church developed two additional roles—the priest (presbyter) and the deacon. Bishops, who serve as the general leaders of local Catholic communities, are primarily responsible for gathering the faithful in prayer during the Eucharist. They are assisted by priests, who also lead the Eucharistic celebrations and administer the sacraments, while deacons attend to widows, orphans, and the poor.
In the year 250, Emperor Decius mandated that all citizens offer sacrifices to the state gods—a decree that many Jews and Christians refused. During that time, many bishops also died as martyrs for their faith; for example, Fabian, the eighth bishop, was executed for his defiant actions. In 251, after Emperor Decius died and was succeeded by Emperor Valerian, further persecutions took place under Valerian’s rule. Following Valerian’s death in 260, a ceasefire occurred amid widespread apprehension between the Church and the Empire. Emperor Constantine ascended to power, ruling over the Western Roman Empire, and declared that everyone was free to worship as they wished within his realm. Miltiades, who then served as bishop, was granted the Lateran Palace near the walls of Rome. However, unlike in the Eastern Roman Empire—where Emperor Licinius continued to persecute Christians—Constantine deployed his troops to take control in the East.
Internal conflicts also emerged within the Church. Differences of opinion arose, notably the views of Arius regarding Jesus as a creation of God, thereby denying the divinity of Christ. Emperor Constantine and the bishops were concerned as Arius quickly gathered many followers—a dispute that persisted for over a century. In the Roman era, the concept of a state religion had taken shape. When Emperor Theodosius came to power and Damasus I became Bishop of Rome, Damasus sought to capitalize on his favorable relationship with the emperor. Gradually, pagan temples began to close down. By the end of the 4th century, Christianity had become strong, and the title “pope” began to be bestowed upon the Bishop of Rome as the supreme leader of the Catholic Church.
The Western Roman Empire began to decline in the 5th century, forcing dioceses to function independently of imperial support. In 440, during the papacy of Leo I, efforts were made to preserve the diocese—coinciding with a diplomatic mission to France as an envoy of Emperor Valentinian III, which underscored Leo’s significant role in Church leadership. Ultimately, the Western Roman Empire ended in 476 with Romulus Augustus as its last emperor. In contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire flourished, even as Western Romans feared an invasion by the Eastern Emperor. Pope Agapetus I even engaged in negotiations with the Eastern Roman Emperor (Byzantium), though these efforts failed. Under Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Empire controlled Italy, intertwining diocesan affairs with Byzantine Church politics. After Justinian’s death in 565, Eastern control over Italy waned.
During the Roman period, areas outside the city of Rome were reclaimed. Emperor Nero (54–68 AD) built villas, gardens, and a necropolis that eventually became a small circus. In 324 AD, Emperor Constantine built a large church, and gradually Nero’s small circus fell into ruin. The story of Peter’s suffering under Nero’s persecution captured the imagination of Christian pilgrims, many of whom wished to be near Saint Peter. To commemorate him, Leo IV (847–855) constructed the Leonine Walls, which became the spiritual center of medieval and Renaissance Rome.
In the Middle Ages, dioceses experienced political tensions. The Eastern Romans still controlled several areas around Rome. When Martinus I became pope, tensions arose with Emperor Constantius II; during a meeting of bishops, criticisms were voiced regarding the theology of the state. Martinus I eventually died after being imprisoned and tried. Relations between Rome and Constantinople were later reestablished by Pope Vitalian. With the diminishing imperial power in the Italian Peninsula, the papacy found it increasingly difficult to defend Rome from invasions by neighboring Germanic peoples, especially the Lombards. In 739, Pope Gregory III was unable to persuade Charles Martel, the leader of the Franks (a Germanic people residing in what is now France). After the Lombards captured the imperial city of Ravenna, Pope Stephen II traveled to Paris to seek assistance. Ultimately, with help from the Frankish leader, the pope was granted territory under Lombard control, laying the foundation for a papal state.
During the era of the “new” Roman Empire, tensions arose once more between the pope and the people of Rome. Pope Leo III was accused of misconduct and adultery, and in an effort to protect himself, he sought assistance—including from Charlemagne, the ruler of the Franks. Charlemagne provided help until Pope Leo III bestowed upon him the title “Emperor of Rome.” From that point on, the Holy Roman Empire was established.
In an extraordinary historical episode, in 1905 at the Council in Clermont, France, Pope Urban II took the bishops to an open field outside the city walls. Speaking from a podium, he urged his listeners to embark on a military expedition to the Holy Land to liberate Jerusalem from Muslim control. Within two years, thousands of people joined the Crusade—they raised their crosses and set out on an armed pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Pope Urban II died in 1099 and was succeeded by Paschal II, followed by a pope focused on church renewal.
Cultural development flourished in Italy during the Renaissance. Scholars, artists, and thinkers brought vibrancy to the era. Pope Nicholas V was among those who played a role in this period—introducing Renaissance ideas into the Vatican. The contributions of the popes are inseparable from the Renaissance, as many of their initiatives produced renowned works of art, particularly in architecture, exemplified by the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. However, in 1439 the threat from the Ottoman Turks became a major concern. A new Crusade was launched under Pope Pius II against the Turks, and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of this Crusade. These events occurred during the Renaissance.
Moving into the Age of Enlightenment, the Thirty Years’ War became one of the significant historical episodes for both Vatican City and the world. For three decades, during the pontificate of Pope Innocent X, Europe was engulfed in fierce religious conflicts. The strife began in 1618 between Catholic and Protestant rulers and gradually spread across the continent, intertwining religious tensions with political and dynastic disputes. The Thirty Years’ War eventually ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Enlightenment era also saw the French Revolution, which upended the European order. Pope Pius VI asserted that the Papal States were situated within a sound and robust economic system. Although the territories of the Catholic Church in France were taken over by the French government, the fall of Robespierre in 1794 signaled a partial restoration of Catholic worship sites in France. Meanwhile, French troops entered Rome and established a Roman Republic under French supervision.
In the 19th century, Italian unification progressed rapidly. The northern Italian kingdoms contributed troops to maintain overall control of Italy. In 1861, Italian soldier Giuseppe Garibaldi declared that Rome would be the capital of Italy, and eventually Italy was unified with Rome as its capital. The Italian government still permitted the existence of the Papal States within the walls of Rome.
In 1914, World War I broke out; that same year, Pope Pius X died and was succeeded by Pope Benedict XV. Pope Benedict XV played an active role in promoting peace and providing aid to the victims of the great war. Furthermore, he supported international reconciliation, including the establishment of an international organization—in this context, the League of Nations. However, mindful of his Papal States, he remained cautious of the war’s influence on their neutrality. His deep sense of compassion and commitment to peace has left him fondly remembered by Catholics worldwide.
When Pope Pius XI assumed the papacy in 1922, seven years later Vatican City officially became an independent, sovereign state. The Lateran Treaty—signed by the papal representative Cardinal Pietro Gasparri and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini—confirmed the recognition of Vatican City’s sovereignty as an independent state with a special status in the world of Catholicism.
Vatican City is a country in Southern Europe, located within Rome, Italy, uniquely positioned as the center of the world’s Catholic faith. Its area covers 400 hectares, or 0.44 square kilometers, which makes it known as the smallest country in the world. Situated within Rome, it borders only Italy. The territory of Vatican City includes St. Peter’s Square, and nearly half of its area is taken up by gardens. Its boundaries generally follow the protective walls built in the 16th century; the granite embankments along the outer edge of St. Peter’s Square mark the boundary between Vatican City and Rome.
Like any country, Vatican City possesses the essential element of territory. Despite its small size, it is home to many famous historical buildings, such as St. Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums, and the Vatican Gardens. Although one of the smallest countries in the world by area, its population density is relatively high. The ratio of native Vatican citizens to non-citizen residents is approximately 4:3, with slightly more citizens than non-citizens—a unique characteristic of this Southern European state. The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, with over 450 holding Vatican citizenship, while the remainder reside in the state on temporary or permanent permits without being citizens. About half of the Vatican citizens do not actually live within the state because many work as diplomatic personnel and reside in various countries around the world. Issues such as the loss of citizenship, residence authorization within Vatican City, and entry formalities are governed by special regulations according to the Lateran Treaty. Overall, the population of Vatican City remains relatively stable from year to year.
The vast majority of residents in Vatican City are Catholic, primarily because they are employed in church services or hold interests related to the Church, as well as in diplomatic roles. Although there is no official language stipulated by law, Vatican City publishes its legal regulations in Italian. On the other hand, the Holy See uses Latin for its most important official documents. Nevertheless, many other languages are used within the city walls. For example, recruits of the Swiss Papal Guard take their oaths in one of the Swiss cantonal languages—such as German, French, or Italian. On its official website, Vatican City is presented in Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish, while the Holy See’s website also includes Latin, Portuguese, and even Chinese.
Based on an interview with Father Bernhard Kieser, S.J, Pastor and Parish Priest of the Catholic Church of Saint Anthony of Padua in Kotabaru, Yogyakarta, research indicates that the population of Vatican City is indeed dominated by individuals involved in church service and those with diplomatic interests. Father Kieser revealed that there are relatively few residents holding Vatican citizenship. Even the head of state is not required to be a Vatican citizen. However, when someone is assigned to work in Vatican City, they may obtain citizenship because of their position or role related to church service. In addition to church and pastoral work and diplomatic positions, there are also roles such as the Pope’s photographer, painting restorers, and gardeners in the Vatican Gardens. Not to be forgotten is the Swiss Guard, who are responsible for the security of Vatican City. Essentially, the residents of this holy city are individuals with positions and interests in both the Church and the state.
In 1929, Vatican City succeeded in establishing itself as an independent, sovereign nation. As the center of the Catholic faith, this state operates a theocratic political system. Beyond its religious interests, Vatican City does not neglect its state functions. This is evidenced by its head-of-state structure and the role of the Roman Curia, the governing body of the Catholic Church. The pope is the highest authority in Vatican City—and indeed for all Catholics worldwide. From a state perspective, the pope serves as both the spiritual father and the head of state. He holds supreme authority over the Universal Church, with the power to appoint or dismiss the Secretary of State and the President of the Papal Commission. Executive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City, which consists of the President of the Papal Commission (who holds the title of President/Governor of Vatican City), the Secretary General, and a Deputy Secretary General, each appointed by the pope for a term of five years. Important actions by the Governor must be confirmed by both the Papal Commission and the pope through the Secretariat of State. The Governor is responsible for overseeing the central government’s functions through various departments and offices, including a modern security corps and police force.
Judicial functions are delegated to the highest court, the appellate court, and other courts and judges. In all cases, the pope may choose at any time to exercise the supreme legislative, executive, or judicial functions. The Roman Curia, the governing body of the Catholic Church, is headed by the Secretary of State. This body is divided into several bureaus—Congregations, Pontifical Councils, and Pontifical Commissions. The Curia serves as a facilitator between Vatican City and Catholics around the world. The Secretary of State, who is the second-highest official in Vatican City, leads the Church’s administrative body. Appointed (and dismissible) by the pope, the Secretary of State acts as the pope’s deputy and is responsible for the Church’s administration. He is assisted by a Secretariat of 70 employees, which is divided into two sections: one for internal Church affairs and one for international relations.
Congregations—similar to ministries in a state—manage relations with local churches. Vatican City’s congregations consist of nine bodies, including the Congregation for Education, the Congregation for Divine Worship, and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. Each congregation is led by a Prefect Cardinal and supported by its staff. Following the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), several Pontifical Councils were established to address issues such as ecumenism, ethics, and social conditions. There are five Pontifical Councils in Vatican City: the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, the Pontifical Council for Peace and Justice, the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, and the Pontifical Council for Assistance to Health Care Workers. These councils were essentially formed to address and respond to various issues. Legislative power is held by the Papal Commission of Vatican City, whose members—cardinals appointed by the pope for a five-year term—must have all actions approved by the pope through the Secretariat of State. The Commission oversees various aspects of Vatican City, including providing for the needs of the faithful and preserving the Church’s heritage.
Greek mythology is a collection of stories about the gods, heroes, and rituals of ancient and classical Greece. Although more critical Greeks—such as the philosopher Plato in the 5th to 4th centuries BC—acknowledged that these myths contain many fictional elements, they were generally regarded as true by the pious in Greek society. Greek mythology went on to have a vast influence on the art and literature of Western civilization, which inherited much of Greek culture. Even though people from every nation, era, and stage of civilization have developed myths to explain natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods or heroes, or justify social or political institutions, Greek myths remain unparalleled in the West as a source of imaginative and captivating ideas. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have drawn inspiration from Greek mythology and discovered contemporary significance and relevance in classical mythological themes. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus noted that Homer and Hesiod provided the Olympian gods with the characteristics by which they are known today. Only a few people today are willing to accept this literally.
